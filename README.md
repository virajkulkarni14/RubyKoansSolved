===============

Ruby Koans are a great way to learn Ruby. These are my solutions to and notes for, Ruby Koans.

From Ruby Koans (http://rubykoans.com/)
"The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in the language."
